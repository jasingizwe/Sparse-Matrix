# Sparse Matrix

## Project Description

This project implements efficient handling and operations for sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are matrices in which most elements are zero, making them suitable for specialized data structures and algorithms. The implemented functionalities include addition, subtraction, and multiplication of sparse matrices, while optimizing memory and runtime performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
- **Code Directory**: `/dsa/sparse_matrix/code/src/`
- **Sample Inputs Directory**: `/dsa/sparse_matrix/sample_inputs/`

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to select a matrix operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication). The program will then load two sparse matrices from specified input files and perform the chosen operation.

### Example

1. **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    ./sparse_matrix
    ```

2. **Select Operation**:
    ```
    Select operation:
    1. Addition
    2. Subtraction
    3. Multiplication
    Enter choice: 1
    ```

3. **Provide Input File Paths**:
    ```
    Enter the path for the first matrix file: /path/to/matrix1.txt
    Enter the path for the second matrix file: /path/to/matrix2.txt
    ```

4. **View Results**:
    The result of the operation will be displayed on the console.
